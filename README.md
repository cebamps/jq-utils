## Installing

Clone, and create a symlink the `cb` directory at `~/.jq/cb`.

Then, `import "cb/arrays"`, or `import "cb"` to import everything through the barrel file in `cb/jq/main.jq`.

In addition it is also possible to create additional shorthand symlinks: `ln -s cb/arrays ~/.jq/arrays` allows to import `"arrays"` instead of `"cb/arrays"`.

## Developing

The barrel file is generated by running `./mkmain`.

Tests are run with `./run-tests`.
