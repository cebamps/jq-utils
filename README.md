## Installing

Clone, and symlink the lib directory under the preferred name in `~/.jq/`, for example, `~/.jq/c`.

Then, `import "c/arrays"`, or `import "c"` to import everything through the barrel file in `lib/jq/main.jq`.

## Developing

The barrel file is generated by running `./mkmain`.

Tests are run with `./run-tests`.
